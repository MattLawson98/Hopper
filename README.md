# Hopper

## About

A react based application designed to simplify the decision making process when out with friends during a pub crawl. 

Any user can use the application, select where they would like to begin their trip, and have pubs be randomly given to them that are within a 1km radius of where they choose to begin their trip. Google Autocomplete, Geolocation, and Places APIs are used to provide this information to the user.
